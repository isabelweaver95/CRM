# Overview

This is a CRM that Real estaate agents can use

The user can input the name of the buyer/seller, the address of the house, if they are interested, their phone number, notes and price

The reason why I wrote this code was to learn how to connect code to a cloud database. 

I am currently am using my hotspot, I have it working but my network is not working to be able to show the data base.I will commit it again when I have a better connection.
